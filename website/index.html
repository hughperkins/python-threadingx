<h1>Python ThreadingX</h1>

<h2>What is Python ThreadingX?</h2>

<p>Python ThreadingX aims to make it easy to write multi-threaded applications in Python, which can run across multiple cores, and avoid issues with the Global Interpreter Lock ("GIL")</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to launch a module as a new process</li>
<li>Easy to communicate with the new process using simple function call symantics</li>
<li>Runs in standard Python</li>
<li>In a multi-core environment, each process can run on a different processor core</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benchmarking</h2>

<p>Compared with Python classic threads, threadx threads are 'heavier', use more memory (about 1MB per process), and have a longer setup time (about 100milliseconds) but can make usage of multiple cores, so once they get going they are a lot faster, up to twice the speed on a dual-core for example.</p>

<h3>primes benchmark</h3>

<p>Calculate prime numbers up to 400000 using a basic sieve of Arystophenes.  Do this four times, in four sub-processes.</p>

<p>The benchmark is in the 'examples' directory, under 'primes'

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Environment: eeepc 901, ubuntu jaunty, Intel Atom (two cores)</p>

<p>Classic python threads:</p>
<pre>
> time python primesclassicthreads.py

real	0m7.110s
user	0m5.828s
sys	0m2.040s
</pre>

<p>ThreadingX:</p>
<pre>
> time python threadxprimes.py 

real	0m3.626s
user	0m6.288s
sys	0m0.288s
</pre>

Whilst the user time is slightly more for threadingx - because of the process setup overhead - the real time is nearly half, because threadingx can take advantage of the two available cores, and is not blocked by python's global interpreter lock.

<h3>md5 benchmark</h3>

<p>Four processes are created, each of which:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a random string of 100,000 letters</li>
<li>return the md5 hexdigest of this string</li>
</ul>

<p>The benchmark is in the 'examples' directory, under 'md5'

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Environment: eeepc 901, ubuntu jaunty, Intel Atom (two cores)</p>

<p>Classic python threads:</p>
<pre>
> time python md5classicthreads.py 

real	0m8.357s
user	0m7.832s
sys	0m1.268s
</pre>

<p>ThreadingX:</p>
<pre>
> time python threadxmd5.py 

real	0m5.154s
user	0m8.989s
sys	0m0.212s
</pre>

Again, whilst the user time is slightly more for threadingx, the real time is nearly half.

<a name='faq'><h2>FAQ</h2></a>

<h3>How does ThreadingX compare with Stackless Python?</h3>

<p>Stackless Python uses 'green' threads which are multitasked within a single operating system thread.
<ul>
<li>This means that stackless python doesn't take advantage of multiple processor cores when they are available</li>
<li>Ultimately, the python Global Interpreter Lock ('GIL') will make it difficult to modify Stackless Python to run across multiple cores effectively</li>
</ul>

<h3>How does ThreadingX compare with Erlang?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Erlang contains OTP, a full-blown infrastructure to manage code replacement and deployment<li>
<li>ThreadingX runs in standard Python, which means things like unicode strings are easy to handle.</li>
<li>ThreadingX doesn't need any knowledge or use of functional programming ('FP') concepts
</ul>

<a name='tutorial'><h2>Tutorial</h2></a>

<p>The tutorial is in two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial part 1: installation, spawn a process, and communicate with it</li>
<li>Tutorial part 2: use the registry process to register and look up process names</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tutorial, part 1: installation, spawn a process, and communicate with it</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download from <a href="http://github.com/hughperkins/python-threadingx/archives/master">python-threadingx</a></li>
<li>Uncompress using tar or unzip</li>
<li>Run 'sudo python setup.py install'</li>
</ul>

<h3>Initializing threadingx</h3>

Create a file called 'main.py', and type in the following:

<pre>
import sys
from threadingxlib import *

threadx = threadingx.ThreadingX()

# step 2 goes here

print "Press 'enter' to exit."
sys.stdin.readline()

threadx.close()
</pre>

<p>Creating an instance of the ThreadingX class will initialize the threadingx environment, and open a listening port on an available port on your machine.</p>

<p>Run the program, then press enter to exit.</p>

<p>If you are on linux, before pressing enter, you can do 'lsof -i -n -P' to see the port opened by the python process.  On Windows you can use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897437.aspx">tcpview</a></p>

<h3>Spawn a child process</h3>

<p>Let's create a child process.  First we need to create a module for the child process.  Let's create a new text file called 'child.py', in the same directory as 'main.py'.  Type the followinig into child.py:</p>

<pre>
import sys
from threadingxlib import *

threadx = threadingx.ThreadingX()

# child step 3 goes here

while threadx.receive():
   pass

threadx.close()
</pre>

<p>This is a simple child module that will simply run, and wait for the main.py process to tell it to shut-down.</p>

<p>The while loop waits for messages to arrive.  If it receives a shutdown message from the parent process, then threadx.receive() will return False, and the loop will exit.

<p>In the main.py, replace the line '# step 2 goes here' with:</p>

<pre>
child = threadx.spawn('child')

# main step 3 goes here
</pre>

<p>threadx.spawn will launch the child.py module, and return a proxy object that can be used to communicate with the new child process.</p>

<p>Run 'python main.py'.  Use 'ps -ef' in linux, or 'taskmgr.exe' in Windows to see that there are two processes running: 'python main.py' and 'python child.py'.  Press enter to shut down the main process.  Use ps -ef or taskmgr, and check that the child process has shut down too.</p>

<h3>Communicate with a child process</h3>

<p>Let's make a method in the child process, and show how easy it is to call from main.</p>

<p>In main.py, replace '# main step 3 goes here' with:

<pre>
# main step 4 goes here

child.sendMessage('hello from main')
</pre>

<p>That's it!  That's all we have to do do call a function in the child process!  The child object represents the child process, and we can call methods on it directly.  Technically, the child object is a 'proxy'.</p>

<p>We need to create the sendMessage method in the child.  In child.py, under '# child step 3 goes here', add a class declaration with a sendMessage method:</p>

<pre>
class ChildService(object):
   def sendMessage( self, sender, message ):
      print "Child received message: " + message

      # child step 4 goes here
</pre>

<ul>
<li>sendMessage has a 'self' argument as for other python class methods, and a second 'sender' argument, which represents the calling process.</li>
<li>For now, we simply print a message to the console, so that we can see that the client received the message ok</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to tell threadingx to route incoming calls to our ChildService object.  We use the 'register_instance' method for this.  Underneath the above code, add in:</p>

<pre>
threadx.register_instance( ChildService() )
</pre>

<p>... now threadingx will attempt to send incoming method calls to the ChildService object.</p>

<p>Run 'python main.py', and you should see the message 'Child received message: hello from main' appear on the console.</p>
<p>Press enter to shut down the processes</p>

<h3>Send a reply to the main process</h3>

<p>To be useful, we need a way to get the child to communicate results back to the main process.  We can do this using the same message-passing semantics we just saw, just in the other direction</p>

<p>In the main.py, under '# main step 4 goes here', add a class to receive the client message:</p>

<pre>
class MainService(object):
   def __init__(self):
      self.isfinished = False

   def finished( self, sender ):
      print 'Finished'
      self.isfinished = True
</pre>

<p>Just underneath this, register a MainService instance with threadingx:</p>

<pre>
mainservice = MainService()
threadx.register_instance( mainservice )
</pre>

<p>Now, the main.py process is ready to receive a 'finished' message from the child.  We want the main process to listen to message from the client, then shut down when it receives the finished message, so replace:

<pre>
print "Press 'enter' to exit."
sys.stdin.readline()
</pre>

with:

<pre>
while not mainservice.isfinished:
   threadx.receive()
</pre>

<p>That's it!  Now when the client calls the 'finished' method, the main process will shut down.</p>

<p>Let's get the child to call the finished method when it receives a message from the main process.  In child.py, underneath '# child step 4 goes here', add the line:

<pre>
      sender.finished()
</pre>

<p>Easy, right?  The sender object is a proxy object that represents the sender process, so we can simply call methods directly on it like this.</p>

<p>Run 'python main.py, and the child process should state that it received a message, and then the main process should say that it is finished, and then they should both shut down automatically.</p>

<h2>Tutorial, part 2: using the registry process to register and lookup process names</h2>

<p>In part 1 we looked at spawning a child process and communicating it.  What do we do if there are lots of child processes and they want to communicate with each other?</p>

<p>One possibility is to use the 'registry' process, which lets a process register a name and a process object.</p>

&lt; To be written &gt;

<p>In the meantime, you can look at the <a href="http://github.com/hughperkins/python-threadingx/tree/master/examples/pingpong/">'pingpong'</a> example in the 'examples' directory for an example of using the registry process.</p>


<a name='technicaldetails'><h2>Technical Details</h2></a>

<p>Each process is a full-blown Python process.  This eliminates issues with the global interpreter lock.  Communications between processes are over TCP/IP sockets.  We could look at short-cutting the sockets in the future.</p>

<p>Child processes are represented by a proxy class, of class ThreadingX.Proxy.  We override the __getattr__ method, so that we can redirect incoming method calls to the child process.</p>

<p>Call marshalling uses standard python pickle.</p>

<p>proxy objects passed as parameters are marshalled as the port number of the process, and then re-wrapped as a proxy object on the other end.</p>

<p>if the name of a called function is not found in the list of methods registered by the child, threadx holds the call in an internal queue until that method is made available</p>
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat analogous to the matching behavior exhibited by Erlang</li>
</ul>

<p>A new registry process is created each time a process runs which is not a child process.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be accessed by the method 'getregistry()' on the threadingx object</li>
<li>A process can be registered by calling 'register('somename', childproxyobject )'</li>
<li>A process proxy object can be obtained by calling 'lookup('somename')' on the registry object.</li>
<ul>
<li>The lookup call is synchronous.  In addition, the registry server waits for the name requested to be available, before responding.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<a name='possibleoptimizations'><h2>Possible optimizations</h2></a>

<p>Possible optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>shortcut the sockets</li>
<li>make socket connections persistent between pairs of processes</li>
</ul>
