Summary
-------

threadingx is designed to emulate some of the threading functionality 
in Erlang.

It makes it easy to spawn new processes, and communicate with them.

Details
-------

Each process is a full-blown Python process, so can run independently on
multi-core hardware.

This contrasts with micro-threading ('green thread') approaches where 
the python global interpreter lock (GIL) means that the green threads
 all run in essentially a single operating system thread, and cannot 
take advantage of multi-core systems.

Communications use sockets, for portability.  Marshalling is done using 
pickle.
